data = LOAD 'TitanicData.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (passengerID:int, survived:int, pClass:int, name:chararray, sex:chararray, age:int, sibSp:int, parch:int, ticket:chararray, fare:float, cabin:chararray, embarked:chararray);

1) In this problem statement we will find the average fare of each class.

grp_class = group data by pClass;
fare_class = foreach grp_class generate $0 as class,AVG(data.fare) as avg_fare;
dump fare_class;

(2,20.66218318109927)

2) In this problem statement we will find the number of people alive in each class and are embarked in Southampton

data_Southampton = FILTER data by embarked=='S';
data_embarkedS_alive = FILTER data_Southampton by survived==0
grp_class_embarkedS_alive = group data_embarkedS_alive by pClass;
result = foreach grp_class_embarkedS_alive generate $0 as class,COUNT(data_embarkedS_alive.survived) as survived_count;
dump result;

(1,53)
(2,88)
(3,286)

3) In this problem statement we will find out number of male and female people died in each class.

data_dead = FILTER data by survived==1;
grp_class_sex = group data_dead by (pClass,sex);
result = foreach grp_class_sex generate $0, COUNT(data_dead.survived) ;
dump result;

((1,male),45)
((1,female),91)
((2,male),17)
((2,female),70)
((3,male),47)
((3,female),72)
